# cse130-tests

A collection of tests for UCSC cse 130 spring 2020.

# Disclaimer

These tests are shared with the permission of the teaching staff of cse 130 and will be removed at the end of the quarter. Passing these tests does not guarantee passing official tests. Some tests may be broken. If you think a test may be broken, submit an issue on github, or better yet fix it yourself and make a pull request and I will include your fix.

# Acknowlegdment

The main test script is based on Aviv's test script from assignment 1. 

# How to use

Go to each assignments folder and check their readme, instructions may differ.

# Contributing

If people contribute, we could have a very large repository of tests that could be run locally! See the [contributing wiki page](https://github.com/zachjicha13/cse130-tests/wiki/Contributing) for how to write test scripts that are compatible with this testing script, which are written in bash (though they can also be written in other scripting languages). dm me on discord if you are not able to contribute through git and I can add you to the collaborators.
